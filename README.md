# startpage-new

Latest version of my custom new tab page, made with plain HTML, CSS and JS.
Also includes a manifest.json for usage as a browser extension.

To use this as a template for your own new tab extension, just edit the links in the HTML.
Then go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode and import the extension using the "import unpacked extension" button. A file selection window should appear: just select the folder with all the files from this repo and that's it!

You are free to use this, just comply with the MIT License if you want to do so :))
