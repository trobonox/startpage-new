# startpage-new

Latest version of my custom new tab page, made with plain HTML, CSS and JS.
Also includes a manifest.json for usage as a browser extension.

Please note that this is not really a template but rather my personal setup, so the time is being forcely displayed in my localisation format and the default search engine is set to startpage.com. Though you are free to clone this repo and edit it however you want.

To use this as a template for your own new tab extension, just edit the links in the HTML.
Then go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode and import the extension using the "import unpacked extension" button. A file selection window should appear: just select the folder which contains all the files from this repo and that's it!

If you want to use this, just make sure you comply with the MIT license.
